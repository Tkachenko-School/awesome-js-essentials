I need to create a set of articles about it. So we need to put a link to our course.

I can also create a list of other courses that I'm also recommending to try.

What i should do next course? Probably promises? it's interesting to me and also there can be a huge part for practices.


I can also collect a lot of links to Mozilla MDN, so I can be indexed better.

I need to figure out where i want to put my practice lessons.

I want to record another 3 hours of practice videos.


maybe i can collect some information during vacation, and then record it with a few days span.



create a list of important things for essentials course.

add fibonacchi and memoization as my basic slides..
